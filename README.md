# Contributing
Pull requests and issues are very welcome if you have any feature requests that you want to make! The current flow for development is making a pull request with the changes you forsee. Once that is done, I can add you as a tester to the Twitter Pack on the Coda side and help you push up a new version with the changes. Then we need to test the changes to make sure they are good before merging.
